# AMA Introduction

Welcome to the documentation page for the AMA bot for ARVRtise! The AMA (Ask Me Anything) bot is designed to answer any question you may have about anything and take your business through the world of Web3. Whether you're a business owner looking to incorporate Web3 into your marketing strategy, a developer interested in building experiences on the platform, or simply curious about the technology, the AMA bot is here to provide answers and insights. In the following chapters you will find a list of prompts that you can use to start a conversation with the bot and get the information you need to make the most of Web3 for your business purposes.

> **Note:** Sometimes AMA may provide seemingly correct but inaccurate answers. Please take AMA's responses as reference opinions, especially when you are unable to verify their correctness through other channels.

## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing appropriate prompts and workflows to interact with AMA. The emergence of our bot is like that of a search engine like Google. Learning how to use it can greatly improve our daily work or life efficiency. However, while it can save you a lot of time, it cannot replace your own thinking and exploration. 

You can also make minor adjustments for the prompts based on your own situation.
